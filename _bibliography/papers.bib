  abstract   = {The technical change from steam engines to electric motors dramatically transformed
  manufacturing activities during the Second Industrial Revolution. This paper
  explores how this technical change progressed and what consequences it brought for
  the evolution of economic geography. I hypothesize that electric motors powered by
  purchased electricity lowered barriers to entry in the manufacturing sector due to
  their significantly lower fixed costs compared to steam engines. To examine this hypothesis,
  I exploit the historical expansion of electricity grids in early 20th-century
  Japan and newly digitized establishment-level official records, including information
  on power sources of establishments. Descriptive evidence shows that electric motors
  were widely adopted by establishments of all sizes, whereas steam engines were primarily
  adopted by large establishments, indicating lower fixed costs of electric motors.
  Using hydropower potential as an instrument, I document that new entrants played a
  crucial role in driving this technical change and stimulating manufacturing activities.
  Overall, these findings lend substantial support for the hypothesis. Furthermore, I find
  that geographical variation in the timing of electricity access influenced subsequent
  population growth, indicating a persistent impact of this technological shock.},
