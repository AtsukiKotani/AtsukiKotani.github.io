I am a first-year PhD student in Economics at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-e.html). My primary research fields are Trade and Development Economics, with a particular focus on the interaction between technology and the spatial distribution of economic activities. I also work on topics related to the role of production networks in shaping international trade.

Before my PhD, I earned an MA in Economics from the [University of Tokyo](https://www.e.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-e.html) and a BA in Economics from [Hitotsubashi University](https://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/eng/).

I am currently applying to PhD programs in the United States and Europe.

**Research Interests**: Trade, Development Economics, Economic History
